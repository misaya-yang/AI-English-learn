# Phase 02 - Public And Auth Surfaces

> For agentic workers: enter plan-first mode before editing. Execute this phase only, write the required evidence, and do not advance to the next phase until acceptance gates pass or blockers are documented.

**Goal:** Complete the Public And Auth Surfaces slice while preserving prior phase contracts and downstream handoff boundaries.

**Architecture:** This phase inherits code facts from `source-packet.md`, boundary decisions from `continuity-ledger.md`, and prior evidence from the dependency phase report.

**Tech Stack:** React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 3, Radix/shadcn-style local components, lucide-react, i18n, Supabase integration, and Playwright-based UI regression scripts.

## Harness Runtime

- FEATURE_ORACLE: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/feature-oracle.json`
- LOOP_CONTRACT: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/loop-contract.json`
- LOOP_STATE: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/loop-state.json`
- PROGRESS_LOG: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/progress-log.md`
- AGENT_HANDOFF: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/agent-handoff.md`
- NEXT_WINDOW_PROMPT: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/next-window-prompt.md`
- CONTINUITY_LEDGER: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/continuity-ledger.md`

Session boot:

1. Read the runtime artifacts above.
2. Follow the loop contract: observe, select, execute, verify, record, decide.
3. Run the target phase's baseline or smoke validation before implementation when available.
4. Select one matching feature-oracle item and keep work scoped to that item and this phase.
5. Summarize inspected code facts and interface decisions back into the source packet and continuity ledger.
6. Update loop state, progress, continuity, and handoff files before exiting.

## Feature Oracle Policy

The feature oracle is the durable test list for long-running agents. Do not delete oracle cases to make completion easier. Update only `status`, `evidence`, and `notes` unless the user explicitly changes scope.

Status rules:

- `failing`: not implemented or not verified.
- `passing`: end-to-end evidence exists.
- `blocked`: a named dependency, credential, environment, or scope issue prevents completion.
- `waived`: the user explicitly waived the case and remaining risk is documented.

## Task Spec

Execute VGUI-02 by using the phase contract, updating VGUI-F003, and preserving the dependency chain `VGUI-00 Baseline UI Audit And Inventory
  -> VGUI-01 Design Tokens And App Shell
  -> VGUI-02 Public And Auth Surfaces
  -> VGUI-03 Dashboard Core Learning Flow
  -> VGUI-04 Skill Modules And Utility Screens
  -> VGUI-05 Regression Evidence And Release Gate`.

## Cross-Phase Continuity

- Depends on: VGUI-01
- Unlocks: VGUI-03
- Feature-oracle item: VGUI-F003
- Continuity ledger: `docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/continuity-ledger.md`
- Prior-phase evidence to inherit: the VGUI-01 phase report, progress-log entry, oracle evidence, and continuity-ledger boundary notes
- Boundary this phase must preserve for later phases: code/interface facts written by prior phases and any downstream contract named in the continuity ledger
- Handoff this phase must produce: phase report, progress-log entry, oracle evidence, source-packet code summary, continuity-ledger update, and agent-handoff next action

## Code Summary Writeback

Before claiming completion, inspect the code paths allowed by this phase and write back:

- `source-packet.md`: summarize discovered files, services, routes, schemas, tests, commands, and runtime constraints.
- `continuity-ledger.md`: record interface boundaries, dependency assumptions, changed contracts, and any downstream phase impact.
- `agent-handoff.md`: state the next concrete action, active feature-oracle item, validation evidence, and blocker status.
- Phase report: link validation output and the exact code-summary update.

## Problem Boundary

In scope:

- Work needed to satisfy VGUI-F003 for Public And Auth Surfaces.
- Code inspection and summary writeback required to keep later phases aligned.

Out of scope:

- Production deployment.
- Production data mutation.
- Unrelated feature work outside this phase chain.

## Context Policy

Before editing, inspect:

- Start with this phase file, `source-packet.md`, `continuity-ledger.md`, and the VGUI-01 phase report.
- Confirm inherited code facts and boundaries before editing.
- Expand repo context only to paths you record back into the source packet.

Do not load unrelated files unless a blocker requires expanding context.

## Requirements

### R1 Homepage Learning Entry

`/` must answer what the learner should practice today. It should show a concrete daily plan, a short sample word or task, and clear CTA behavior for guest and authenticated users.

### R2 Public Study Surfaces

`/word-of-the-day` and `/demo` must feel like learning artifacts. They should prioritize word, usage, task, save/practice actions, and honest sample-state copy.

### R3 Auth Surfaces

`/login`, `/register`, `/magic-link`, `/auth/callback`, and `/onboarding` must be calm, fast, and clear. Demo behavior, provider failure, legal links, form validation, and loading states must be visible and understandable.

### R4 Pricing And Legal

`/pricing`, `/terms`, and `/privacy` must preserve billing honesty and legal caveats while using the same light-first visual language.

## Test and Regression Requirements

Run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run check:i18n
npm run build
npm test -- --run src/pages/Home.i18n.test.tsx src/pages/Home.trust.test.ts src/pages/PricingPage.test.tsx src/pages/WordOfTheDayPage.test.tsx src/pages/auth/AuthPages.i18n.test.tsx src/features/marketing/AuthShell.test.tsx
```

Capture desktop and mobile screenshots for `/`, `/pricing`, `/word-of-the-day`, `/demo`, `/login`, `/register`, `/magic-link`, `/onboarding`, `/terms`, and `/privacy`.

## Compliance and Safety Requirements

Do not change billing fail-closed behavior, demo semantics, legal routes, or auth provider semantics. Public CTAs must not use nested interactive controls.

## Rollback and Recovery

Rollback is reverting public/auth page, marketing shell, and route-level style changes while preserving VGUI-01 token work.

## Execution Capture

Write the phase report, append progress-log evidence, update oracle evidence, update continuity-ledger boundaries, and refresh agent-handoff next action.

Use ``docs/vocabdaily-global-ui-upgrade-prd/reports/phase-report-template.md`` when writing the phase report.

## Evaluator Protocol

Reject completion if the homepage still reads as an AI SaaS page, if auth pages hide failure states, if CTA labels clip at 390px, or if public pages regress legal/billing/auth semantics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- VGUI-F003 has route screenshots and validation evidence.
- Homepage first viewport says what to practice today.
- Public pages do not use black-grid, glass, or emerald-only identity.
- Auth pages show clear loading, error, demo, and legal states.
- VGUI-03 receives stable shell and public-entry assumptions.

## Risks

- Copy can become cute or vague while trying to sound polished.
- Auth UI changes can accidentally change form semantics.
- Pricing visual cleanup can obscure fail-closed billing truth.
